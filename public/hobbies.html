            I am a sports enthusiast and I do like running, cycling, hiking, mountaineering, and skiing. I tried myself also in sport<br />
            climbing and I loved it. Climbing is a team sport and at these heights you really must trust each other. As I like being<br />
            on solid ground, I also like being in and on the water. Accordingly, I got my Boat Leader's License of Competence (up to 24m)<br />
            and License of Competence for VHF GMDSS Station. Following this I joined myself to a team of 5 and we sailed from Cherbourg<br />
            in Normandy, France all the way to Lisbon the capital of Portugal. That was really a unique experience for me. A voyage of<br />
            roughly 1000 nautical miles including Bay of Biscay crossing. So, a true-blue water leg of sailing. Not to mention that before<br />
            I did only a shy 100 miles of sailing in the Adriatic Sea. Did I mention that I like to travel, get to know other people and<br />
            their culture, and admire all our planet Earth has to offer.
            <br />
            <br />
            As much as I like being physically in movement, I also like to keep my brains content and feed them by all the good staff books<br />
            can provide, learning new soft and hard skills. What "food" is better for brains than learning new languages or programing? 
            <br />
            <br />
            I really look forward to learn how to design and build a webpage from scratch!
